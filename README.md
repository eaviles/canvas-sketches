# Daily Creative Coding Sketches

Inspired by [Zach Lieberman's](http://zach.li/) [daily sketches experiment](https://medium.com/@zachlieberman/daily-sketches-2016-28586d8f008e), this repository contains my sketches in JavaScript using Matt DesLauriers's [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) framework. While the intention will be to code one each day I recognize in advance it will be almost impossible so apologies to future me and friendly folks looking at this.
